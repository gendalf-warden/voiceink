## [Unreleased]

## [0.4b] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Post-processing modes** (P5.7, P5.8): replaces the single punctuation toggle
  with three selectable modes applied to dictation and file transcription
  independently — `Off` (raw Whisper), `Smart` (combined punctuation + grammar +
  bullet-list detection in one LLM pass), and `Translate` (target language).
- **Translation mode**: translate into 13 languages (en, ru, hy, es, fr, de, it,
  pt, pl, tr, zh, ja, ko, ar). Hallucination guards (3× length, script
  preservation) are disabled for this mode since the script change is intentional.
- **Menu bar mode submenu**: status bar shows `Dictation: X` and `File: Y` with
  submenus that include all 3 modes and checkmark the current selection.
- **Settings UI**: two `NSPopUpButton`s for dictation/file modes; translate-target
  picker appears only when at least one mode is `Translate`.
- **PostProcessingPipeline** helper + `LLMProcessor` protocol — extracted
  testable post-processing contract; `LlamaClient` and `OllamaClient` conform.
- **Smoke tests** (P5.9): unit tests covering mode→prompt mapping, Codable
  round-trip, legacy `punctuationEnabled` migration, length/script guards, fail-safe
  on LLM error, tolerance of unknown raw values. Manual mode regression checklist
  (19 cases) added to TESTS.md §6.7.

### Changed
- **Config schema**: `punctuationEnabled` / `filePunctuationEnabled` (booleans)
  replaced with `dictationMode` / `fileMode` (`PostProcessingMode` enum) plus
  `translateTarget` (ISO 639-1 code). Old v0.3b configs decode transparently:
  `true → .smart`, `false → .off`. The `.smart` case persists with raw value
  `"punctuation"` to preserve this mapping.
- LLM client API: `postProcess(text:)` → `process(text:systemPrompt:)`.
- `FileTranscriptionManager.punctuationEnabled` → `mode` + `translateTarget`.
- Unknown mode raw values (e.g. `"grammar"` / `"list"` from intermediate dev
  builds) are now silently ignored on decode rather than rejecting the whole
  config.

### Fixed
- Switching dictation mode from menu bar (e.g. `Off → Translate`) now actually
  loads the LLM. Previous behaviour: config updated and saved, but no LLM was
  started, so the next dictation silently fell back to raw Whisper output.

## [0.3b] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Model download on first launch**: models (~3.5 GB) downloaded from GitHub
  Releases instead of bundled in .app — DMG shrunk from 3.4 GB to 9.5 MB
- **ModelManager**: sequential download with URLSession resume, SHA256 verification,
  CoreML zip/unzip, disk space check
- **ModelDownloadWindowController**: per-file progress bars, speed indicator,
  cancel/retry, localized (en/ru)
- **Hybrid Dock management**: Dock icon appears temporarily when any window is open
  (proper focus, Cmd+Tab), disappears when all windows close. Fixes invisible
  windows on LSUIElement apps
- **Replacements dictionary** (P5.4): user-defined word replacements applied after
  Whisper, before LLM. Native macOS table editor with live search field, click-to-edit
  cells, ± buttons. Menu: Replacements… (Cmd+R)
- **LLM lazy lifecycle**: when dictation punctuation is OFF but file punctuation is
  ON, LLM is loaded only during file transcription and unloaded after — saves ~2 GB
  idle RAM
- **Localization (en/ru)**: Settings window, download window with functional model
  names ("Speech recognition", "GPU acceleration", "Smart punctuation")
- **UIPreview executable target** for fast UI iteration: `./scripts/preview-ui.sh`

### Changed
- **Punctuation defaults**: dictation OFF, file transcription ON (RAM > 8 GB) —
  matches real-world usage where file transcription benefits more from LLM
- Settings window no longer floats above other apps
- Dev build version label is now `{VERSION}+dev` instead of just `dev`
- LLM startup logic refactored: `startLLMSync()` / `ensureLLMReady()` /
  `releaseLazyLLM()` helpers in AppDelegate

### Fixed
- Download window invisible after first-run wizard on other Macs (LSUIElement
  focus loss after Accessibility system dialog)
- LLM was not started when only file transcription needed it

## [0.2b] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Chunked file transcription** — splits WAV into 30s chunks at silence boundaries, streams results
- **Parallel ASR/LLM pipeline** — concurrency=2, 2.1× speedup (9× → 18.7× RTF on 45-min file)
- **Streaming result window** — progress bar, live stats, elapsed + ETA, realtime factor, words/min
- **Export transcription** as TXT / SRT / MD (save dialog with format popup)
- **Timestamp toggle** in result window
- **Whisper hallucination filter** — strips "Продолжение следует...", lone "you", subtitle credits
- **Standalone hallucination removal** — entire chunks that are just hallucinations dropped
- **Language detection + script verification**: auto-detect from first chunk, re-transcribe mismatched chunks with forced language, drop if still mismatched
- **CJK character stripping** — defense against Chinese/Japanese/Korean hallucinations on unclear audio
- **LLM translation detection** — if LLM changed script while raw was correct, use raw (qwen2.5:3b sometimes ignores "do not translate" rule)
- **Trailing silence trim** in AudioRecorder — prevents Whisper hallucinations at recording end
- **Min recording length** (0.5s) — skips accidental Fn taps
- **Undo Dictation** menu item (Cmd+Z) — selects and deletes last inserted text
- **Split smart-punctuation toggle**: separate settings for dictation (default on) and file transcription (default off)
- 33 new unit tests: AudioConverter chunking, Transcriber (hallucinations, scriptMatches, stripForeignChars, toISOCode)

### Changed
- **LLM prompt** hardened against hallucination on short phrases ("save memory" → essay)
- **3× length guard** for LLM output — if result is 3× longer than input, use raw text
- Settings window widened 420 → 500px for longer Russian labels
- Settings label renamed: "Продвинутая пунктуация" → "Умная пунктуация при диктовке" + new "... при транскрипции файлов"
- `build-app.sh` auto-strips `com.apple.provenance` xattr to prevent macOS launch blocks

### Fixed
- Chinese/Japanese/Korean hallucinations in Russian audio
- English hallucinations on noisy Russian chunks ("To be two bases were identical")
- LLM translating Russian to English despite "do not translate" in prompt
- Whisper language API: ISO code normalization (whisper returns "russian", -l expects "ru")

## [0.1b] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Push-to-talk voice dictation with Fn hotkey (or any modifier+key)
- whisper-server ASR with large-v3-turbo model (Metal + CoreML)
- LLM punctuation via bundled llama-server + Ollama fallback
- File transcription (mp3, wav, m4a, mp4, mov) with LLM post-processing
- Settings window with hotkey recorder, punctuation toggle
- Menu bar with animated state icons and version number
- Splash window with progress bar at startup
- DMG installer with drag-to-Applications
- First-run wizard for Microphone + Accessibility permissions
- Auto-retry CGEventTap (no restart needed after granting Accessibility)
- Punctuation toggle for low-RAM machines (disabled by default on <=8 GB)
- Dev/release build separation with VERSION file
